# E-Commerce_dataProcessing
E-Commerce Data Processing System with Batch Jobs

The goal of this project is to create an E-Commerce Data Processing System that can read large volumes of data from various sources (like CSV, JSON, or database), process the data in batches (using Spring Batch), and store the results in a database.

This project can involve the following components:

E-Commerce Management: Basic features to create, update, and delete data records.
Batch Processing: Use Spring Batch to read, process, and write data in batches, such as importing large CSV files.

Scheduling: Automate batch job execution, for example, scheduling the batch job to run every night or on weekends.

Reporting: Generate reports based on e-commerce data, like order history
